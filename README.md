# Simple Desktops Scraper 

Downloads all wallpapers from simpledesktops.com (requires Python 3.x)

# Guide for Windows:

1) Install Python 3.x from Python.org
2) Download the .py folder from this repository
3) Copy it to the folder where you want to download all the wallpapers
4) Double-click it
5) Wait (Due to the actual website being relatively small, and Python not really being the fastest language there is, expect this step to take a while)

Note:
If the program finds a file already downloaded, it will stop. Because of this, you can use it to update your wallpaper dir whenever a new wallpaper is posted. To disable this, open the py file in notepad and change the first line from 'STOP_IF_FOUND = True' to 'STOP_IF_FOUND = False' (mind the capital F)
